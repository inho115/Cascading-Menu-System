# Academic Integrity
This project was milestone project for Introduction to Object Oriented Programming (OOP244) in Seneca College.<br />Do not use materials for your assignments.<br />Materials and instruction were given by instructor at Seenca College.
# Introduction
This project demonstrates the basic concepts that are covered in object oriented programming in C++.<br />This system is a cascading menu system that can load information from a text file, list all items, add item, remove item, update quantity, sort, and create a new file.
# Implemented Concepts
- Classes
- Contructor
- Destructor
- Copy Constructor
- Copy Assingment
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Inheritance
- Derived Classes
- Helper Functions 
- Pointers
- I/O Objects (ostream, istream, filestream)
- Arrays
# Program Operation
To reduce a repetitiveness, this demonstration will be displaying only option one, two, three, four, and five.<br /><br />
This system displays number of options for a user to select at start screen.<br />To access these options, the user must enter a desired file name as an input.<br /><br />
